 Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This document provides the latest release information for the XBee Library for
 Xamarin, which allows customers to easily develop Xamarin applications that
 communicate with XBee modules over Bluetooth Low Energy.

 XBee Library for Xamarin v1.0.2, November 2022
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Supported Hardware:
      * XBee modules:
        * XBee/XBee-PRO RF Module Family
          * XBee 3 (Zigbee 3, DigiMesh 2.4, 802.15.4 and Cellular)

 2. Changes with respect to previous version:
      * Fixed a BLE connection problem for some Android devices.
      * Updated the Nuget packages of the library to their latest version.

 XBee Library for Xamarin v1.0.1, September 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Supported Hardware:
      * XBee modules:
        * XBee/XBee-PRO RF Module Family
          * XBee 3 (Zigbee 3, DigiMesh 2.4, 802.15.4 and Cellular)

 2. Changes with respect to previous version:
      * Limited the number of bytes that can be sent per operation to other
        XBee interfaces to 255 bytes.
      * The library now splits and sends data in chunks when it exceeds the
        MTU size.
      * Added more possibilities to instantiate XBeeBLEDevice classes.
      * Updated the Plugin.BLE nuget version to 2.1.1 in the examples and
        library.
      * Examples:
        * Updated the Anddroid SDK target version to API 28.
        * Updated the minimum iOS version to 10.2
        * Added 2 new keys in iOS to allow the examples to use Bluetooth.

 XBee Library for Xamarin v1.0.0, August 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Supported Hardware:
      * XBee modules:
        * XBee/XBee-PRO RF Module Family
          * XBee 3 (Zigbee 3, DigiMesh 2.4, 802.15.4 and Cellular)

 2. Changes with respect to previous version:
      * Library features (most of them are inherit from the XBee C# Library):
        * Support for Zigbee, 802.15.4, DigiMesh and Cellular XBee 3 devices.
        * Support for communicating with XBee devices over Bluetooth Low Energy.
        * Configuration of local XBee devices:
          * Configure common parameters with specific setters and getters.
          * Configure any other parameter with generic methods.
          * Execute AT commands.
          * Apply configuration changes.
          * Write configuration changes.
        * IO lines management:
          * Configure IO lines.
          * Set IO line value.
          * Read IO line value.
        * Support for User Data Relay frames, allowing the communication between
          different interfaces (Serial, Bluetooth Low Energy and MicroPython).

      * Xamarin application examples demonstrating some API specific features.
        * Configure XBee devices over Bluetooth Low Energy.
        * Send and receive data over Bluetooth Low Energy to a micro-controller
          connected to the XBee serial interface.
        * Send and receive data over Bluetooth Low Energy to the XBee
          MicroPython interface.
        * Communicate with XBee devices over Bluetooth Low Energy and send data
          to other XBee interfaces.

      * Comprehensive online documentation including:
        * Getting Started Guide.
        * Users Guide.
        * API Reference Manual.
