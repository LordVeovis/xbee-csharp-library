# XBee C# Library [ ![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/XBeeLibrary.Core)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XBeeLibrary.Core/) [ ![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/XBeeLibrary.Xamarin)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XBeeLibrary.Xamarin/)

This project contains the source code of the XBee C# Library, an easy-to-use 
API developed in C# that allows you to interact with Digi International's
[XBee](http://www.digi.com/xbee/) radio frequency (RF) modules. This source has 
been contributed by [Digi International](http://www.digi.com) from the original
work of Sébastien Rault.

The XBee C# library has two modules: **XBeeLibrary.Core**, which contains all
the common code for any platform, and **XBeeLibrary.Xamarin**, which contains
the necessary APIs to develop multi-platform mobile applications with Xamarin
to communicate with XBee devices over Bluetooth Low Energy.

The project includes the C# source code and multiple examples that show how to
use the available APIs. The examples are also available in source code format.

The main features of the library include:

* Support for ZigBee, 802.15.4, DigiMesh, Point-to-Multipoint and Cellular
XBee devices.
* Support for API and API escaped operating modes.
* Support for communicating with XBee devices over Bluetooth Low Energy
(XBeeLibrary.Xamarin).
* Management of local (attached to the host) and remote XBee device objects.
* Discovery of remote XBee devices associated with the same network as the 
local device.
* Configuration of local and remote XBee devices:
  * Configure common parameters with specific setters and getters.
  * Configure any other parameter with generic methods.
  * Execute AT commands.
  * Apply configuration changes.
  * Write configuration changes.
  * Reset the device.
* Transmission of data to all the XBee devices on the network or to a specific 
device.
* Reception of data from remote XBee devices:
  * Data polling.
  * Data reception callback.
* Transmission and reception of IP and SMS messages.
* Reception of network status changes related to the local XBee device.
* IO lines management:
  * Configure IO lines.
  * Set IO line value.
  * Read IO line value.
  * Receive IO data samples from any remote XBee device on the network.
* Support for explicit frames and application layer fields (Source endpoint, 
Destination endpoint, Profile ID, and Cluster ID).
* Support for User Data Relay frames, allowing the communication between
different interfaces (Serial, Bluetooth Low Energy and MicroPython).
